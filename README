NGINXiFY (i'm a 1337 hack0r -_-) takes a folder with apache files and transforms them to nginx config files.

# folder where your apache files are
input_folder = "/Users/rickashley/conf/"

# folder where you want your nginx files 
output_folder = "/Users/rickashley/nginx"

nginx = Nginxify::Base.new(input_folder, output_folder)
nginx.convert!

You will need to rename your nginx files when they are down processing they will have .nginx suffixed.

This is in no way tested or reliable, if it explodes your computer don't blame me but fix it! (please)
